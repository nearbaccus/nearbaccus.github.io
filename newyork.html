    <div><strong>About: </strong>First established in the cultural melting pot of Chinatown, New York, Taiyaki NYC has since expanded to the arts district of Wynwood Miami, Florida, as Taiyaki NYC Miami. Our goal is to work with and to give back to the community the best we can. By doing so, we hope to build a community store that is deeply rooted in the neighborhood we serve.
      Weâ€™re known for our fish-shaped Japanese waffle that is chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside; the textures and flavors blend perfectly in glorious harmony with the artisan flavors of soft serve ice cream.</div>
