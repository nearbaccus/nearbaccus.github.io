    <div><strong>About:</strong> A scenic ferry ride from Seattle, to Bainbridge Island, we make ice cream in small batches using fresh milk, real eggs and cane sugar. On a visit to our creamery you might find us slowly toasting pistachio nuts or melting Belgian chocolate.
      We might be squeezing pink grapefruit, peeling fresh cantaloupes or chopping ripe pears. Our goal? To make ice cream the old-fashioned way, the way your great-grandmother did, combining the best ingredients she could find with the deep-seated desire to nourish and care for her family.
      In fact, we’ve developed more than 70 flavors, which we add to regularly, and on any given day you’ll find 48 on hand. With so many options, there’s sure to be a flavor to suit every palate!For us, the experience of eating ice cream is just as important as the ice cream itself.So that we could share the experience of “meeting and eating” with our friends and neighbors on our adopted island, we opened our Bainbridge Island shop in 2006.
      Whatever the temperature outside, inside our shop you’ll find people laughing, joking, talking and savoring Mora ice cream in cups or cones, as milkshakes, floats or parfaits.
